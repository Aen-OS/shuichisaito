# my website
https://shuichi-saito.github.io/shuichisaito/

Was planning to update it and host a blog on there using an embedded instagram or twitter feed but the website no longer really interests me all that much. I still think about updating it but I mean, a website using wordpress or wix looks so much better especially to employers or anyone else.
